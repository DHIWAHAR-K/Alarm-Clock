# Alarm Clock in Python

## Overview

This Python script implements a simple alarm clock that allows users to set alarms and receive notifications when the specified time is reached. The script utilizes the `datetime` and `time` modules for time-related functionalities and provides an interactive command-line interface for setting alarms. Explore this script to understand the basics of building an alarm clock in Python.

## Script Components

- **User Input:** Code for user input to set the alarm time.
- **Alarm Setting:** Logic for setting the alarm based on user input.
- **Notification:** Generating a notification when the alarm time is reached.
- **Output Display:** Displaying messages and notifications for the user.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`alarm_clock.py`) in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to set the alarm time.
3. The script will display messages and notifications when the alarm time is reached.

## Customization

- Experiment with different alarm sounds or notification methods.
- Modify the script to include additional features such as recurring alarms.
- Adapt the code to integrate with external libraries for more advanced notification options.
